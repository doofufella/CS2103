# CS2103/T: Software Engineering

Hi this is essentially a *clone* of CS2103's [official repo](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S2/ip). 
We shall use this to simulate the **source repo** for pushing pull requests to, i.e. this repo will accept/reject pull requests.

---
To my understanding, CS2103 uses the fork & pull request model.
1. Fork the source repo (this one)
2. Choose a task & base branch (no task so just use main)
3. Clone the fork to your computer
4. Create a new branch (with a meaningful name) from the base branch you chose(should be main)
5. Make commits
6. Push branch to the GitHub fork; then create a pull request from your branch to the [base branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
